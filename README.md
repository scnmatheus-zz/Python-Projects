  I fell in love with the simple way that python tries to be, it's a very light language, easy to understand, during months of study I was able to understand, slicing of string, vectors, lists, so I see this as a simple start, I still have a lot to learn, ðŸ¤“. Of course, always remembering that it must be only one step at a time, I cannot exaggerate what I learned. I learned things like:
  
  * slicing of string
  * variable
      * lists
      * vectors
  * condition
  * repetitions

  but this is just the beginning
