  when I started my studies in python, I fell in love with the principles that the language provides, it is very light and easy to understand, I managed to learn a lot of things in my last months like:
  
  * slicing of string
  * variable
      * lists
      * vectors
  * condition
  * repetitions

  but this is just the beginning
